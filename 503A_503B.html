    Section 503A and 503B Compounding Pharmacies
  </header>

  <main>
    <h1>What Are 503A and 503B?</h1>
    <p>These terms refer to two distinct sections of the <strong>Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)</strong> that describe how pharmacies compound medications in the United States.</p>

    <h2>üíä Section 503A ‚Äî Traditional Compounding Pharmacies</h2>
    <p><strong>Who they are:</strong> Local or community pharmacies that compound customized drugs for individual patients based on a valid prescription.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Each compounded product must be patient-specific.</li>
      <li>Regulated mainly by state pharmacy boards.</li>
      <li>Not required to follow full FDA manufacturing standards (like cGMP).</li>
      <li>Cannot make or sell bulk drugs for general use.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <strong>Example:</strong> A pharmacist compounds a dye-free tablet for a patient allergic to coloring agents.
    </div>

    <h2>üíä Section 503B ‚Äî Outsourcing Facilities</h2>
    <p><strong>Who they are:</strong> Larger compounding facilities that produce sterile drugs in bulk without patient-specific prescriptions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Must register with the FDA as outsourcing facilities.</li>
      <li>Must comply with <strong>current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Can compound sterile drugs in batches for hospital or office use.</li>
      <li>Subject to FDA inspections and federal oversight.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <strong>In short:</strong> 503A pharmacies focus on individualized therapy; 503B facilities operate like small-scale manufacturers ensuring sterility and quality under cGMP.
    </div>

    <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Key Differences Between 503A, 503B, and FDA-Approved Drugs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>503A:</strong> Patient-specific, no FDA approval, state-regulated, not cGMP-compliant.</li>
      <li><strong>503B:</strong> Bulk sterile production, FDA oversight, cGMP-compliant, but not FDA-approved for efficacy.</li>
      <li><strong>FDA-Approved:</strong> Fully reviewed through NDA/ANDA, supported by clinical and bioequivalence data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üè≠ Is a 503B Facility Like a Small Drug Factory?</h2>
    <p>Yes. It operates under cGMP and FDA inspection like a manufacturer, but it does not develop or seek approval for new drugs. Its role is to compound existing APIs into usable sterile preparations.</p>

    <h2>üè• Relationship with Hospitals</h2>
    <p>Most 503B facilities are independent, though some hospitals may own affiliated outsourcing facilities to supply sterile injectables internally.</p>

    <h2>‚öóÔ∏è Restrictions on 503B Facilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Can only compound ingredients on FDA‚Äôs approved bulk list or those on drug shortage lists.</li>
      <li>Cannot copy FDA-approved drugs unless unavailable.</li>
      <li>Cannot make biologics or controlled substances without proper authorization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üß† Clinical Pharmacology Relevance</h2>
    <p>503B products do not undergo bioequivalence or clinical trials; hence, their PK/PD may differ from approved drugs. However, they ensure continuity of supply in critical settings.</p>

    <div class="summary-box">
      <strong>Key takeaway:</strong>  
      503B drugs are sterile and GMP-compliant but not clinically validated for efficacy.  
      FDA-approved drugs are fully evaluated for safety, efficacy, and bioequivalence.
